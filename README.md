# My-Activity---Google-Take-Out 
From Google take out I issued all the queries I have used in the past years and ploted a log-log graph such that the Y-axis is the number of times each query was issued and on the X-axis is the rank of the query starting from the most popular query (rank 1) all the way to the least popular query. 
I also ploted a histogram of the number of queries you made each year.
